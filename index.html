        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Adodo Silias Odion, born on the 26th of September. I am
          currently a student at AltSchool Africa, with the student ID
          <b>ALT/SOE/025/3757</b>, and in my final semester in the Department of
          Mechanical Engineering Technology (Plant & Power option). While I have
          gained valuable experience in engineering, my passion lies in
          transitioning into the tech industry—particularly in the fields of
          Cloud Computing and DevOps Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          To actively pursue this career path, I enrolled in a 6-month Cloud and
          DevOps bootcamp with HAGITAL Consulting, which I began in October 2024
          and successfully completed in April 2025. Building on this foundation,
          I recently took another step forward by registering for a one-year
          Cloud Computing diploma program with <b>AltSchool Africa</b> in June
          2025. Currently enrolled in
          <strong>ALT School Africa — School of Engineering</strong>. I am
          committed to continuously developing my skills and growing my
          expertise in the cloud technology space.
